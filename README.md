# PSA-Code-Sprint-2024

## Problem Statement

As a leading global port operator and supply chain solutions provider, PSA recognizes the critical importance of resilient port operations in today's volatile global landscape. Recent events, such as the Red Sea crisis and its ripple effects on global shipping, have underscored the need for enhanced adaptability in port management.  â€‹

We invite participants to develop an innovative data and AI-driven solution that optimizes port resilience and efficiency across our global network.  

The aim is to reinforce PSA's position as a resilient and reliable partner at multiple nodes in global supply chains to create a Node-to-Network effect.
